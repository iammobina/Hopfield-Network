#  Hopfield Network

Designed a Hopfield Network and trained it on the images of the first 10 letters of the English alphabet in order to get a noisy image and then correct it. Added noise to X percent of each of the images and then give them to my network. In the end, I calculated the networkâ€™s accuracy.
